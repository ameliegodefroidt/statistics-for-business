# Statistics for Business – Interactive Tools

This repository contains a set of **interactive apps and resources** to support the *Statistics for Business* course at IESEG School of Management.  

The aim is to complement lecture slides with hands-on tools that let students **explore data, visualize patterns, and understand key statistical concepts interactively**.

### 🚀 App 1: Variability




### 🚀 App 2: Distributions

The first app included in this repository is designed for class participation.  
Students can enter their own values for three variables:

- **Height (cm)**  
- **Shoe size (EU)**  
- **Number of siblings**  

The app then produces:

1. A histogram of heights (with optional normal curve overlay).  
2. A histogram of shoe sizes (with optional normal curve).  
3. A bar chart of the number of siblings (to highlight a non-normal distribution).  

This illustrates that some data resemble the **normal distribution**, while other variables follow **different patterns**.

#### 🎓 Learning Goals

- Recognize that many variables cluster around the mean and resemble the **normal distribution**.  
- Understand that not all data are normal — discrete or skewed variables follow different distributions.  
- Gain intuition for why distributional assumptions matter in statistical analysis.

## 👩‍🏫 Instructor

This repository is maintained by **[Your Name]**, instructor of *Statistics for Business* at **[Your Institution]**.  

The aim is to make statistics more **interactive, intuitive, and engaging** by letting students experiment with data themselves.
