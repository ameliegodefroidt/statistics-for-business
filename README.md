# Statistics for Business


## 1. Distributions Shiny App

This Shiny app is designed for teaching **introductory statistics** to students.  
It lets students enter their own values for three variables:

- **Height (cm)**
- **Shoe size (EU)**
- **Number of siblings**

The app then plots:

1. A histogram of heights (with optional normal curve overlay).  
2. A histogram of shoe sizes (also with optional normal curve).  
3. A bar chart of the number of siblings (to highlight a non-normal distribution).  

Together, these visuals show that different types of data follow different distributions.

### ðŸŽ“ Learning Goals

- Understand that many phenomena cluster around the mean and resemble the **normal distribution**.  
- Recognize that not all variables follow a normal distribution (e.g., discrete counts like siblings).  
- Compare and interpret real-world distributions in a classroom setting.
